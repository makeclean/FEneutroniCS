FEneutroniCS
============

Neutronics using FEniCS.

This package aims at solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation as used in the computational neutron transport community.
Discretization is done using Finite Elements for the spatial variable, and Spherical Harmonics for the angular variable.
It is based on the FEniCS Project (http://fenicsproject.org/), a collection of free software with an extensive list of features for automated, efficient solution of differential equations.

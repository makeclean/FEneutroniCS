FEneutroniCS
============

Neutronics using FEniCS.

This package aims at solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation as used in the computational neutron transport community.
It is based on the FeniCS Project (http://fenicsproject.org/), a collection of free software with an extensive list of features for automated, efficient solution of differential equations.
